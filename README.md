Hydra Ryder 1.0
===============

A game that demonstrates combining the Razer Hydra with Torque 3D, an open source game engine.


How to Play
-----------

Before playing you must calibrate your Razer Hydra controller.  This provides Torque 3D with the location of your shoulders relative to the Hydra base unit.  Just follow the on-screen prompts after pressing the Play button after starting up the game.

Once you are in the game try to hit the various targets with your dual pistols.  For better accuracy try using the pistol's iron sights.  To reset the tin cans press one of the Hydra's shoulder buttons.
